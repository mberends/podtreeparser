=begin pod
Document p08-code.pod tests the C formatting code.
The C < > formatting code specifies that the contained text is code;
that is, something that might appear in a program or specification.
Such content would typically be rendered in a fixed-width font
(preferably a different font from that used for the T < > or K < >
formatting codes) or with  < samp > ... < /samp > tags.
The contents of a C < > code are space-preserved and verbatim.
The C < > code is the inline equivalent of the =code block.

Preserve the punctuation and C<say "---   ---";> three spaces.

Also preserve C<if $a < 5 and $a > 0 { say "yes"; }> markup characters.

Multiple angles C<< $a = ( $b > $c );>> also delimit.
